# Chernobyl_Virtual-Reality
My internship project about Chernobyl in VR and AR.
If you want to play the demo version of the Chernobyl application in Virtual Reality. You need to download all the zip files from the github to a separate folder on your computer and then open to the zip archive "Demo_ChernobylVR_Unity3D.zip" and open the "ChernobylVR.exe" file.
